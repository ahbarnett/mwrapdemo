% MWrap file for C++ demo w/ OpenMP.
% Generates gateway.cc, array2d.m and array2domp.m.
% Illustrates inout type, and multiple interfaces in a single gateway.
% First see ../c/demo.mw on which this example builds.

@function y=array2d(x,reps)
% ARRAY2D  compute iterated sin of all elements of a 2D array
%
% y = array2d(x,reps) returns in y all elements of a 2D array x after sin is
%  applied to them reps times.
%
% Note: single-threaded MEX

N = numel(x);   % total size
% MATLAB preallocation of y needed since it's 'inout' type
y = x;
% Note: treated as contiguous 1D array as far as C is concerned:
# array2d(int N, inout double[N] y, int reps);

% ARRAY2DOMP  compute iterated sin of all elements of a 2D array
