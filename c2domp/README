Simple MWrap demo for interfacing MATLAB to a C library via MEX with OpenMP.
Barnett 7/30/15

To build the interface:
make

Test script to run from a MATLAB shell:
test

To clean up this directory:
make clean

Notes:

Running the makefile does this:
1) compiles the lib.c library into lib.o
2) uses MWrap to read demo.mw and auto-generate gateway.c and array2domp.m
   (it's worth looking at these two files for education purposes only)
3) calls the MEX compiler to compile gateway.c and link to lib.o to
   give the MEX executable object gateway.mexa64 (for instance)
In the MWrap documentation "gateway" is called "outputmex".

Running the test script does this: calls the autogenerated MATLAB
wrapper array2domp.m which calls the MEX executable. The result is checked
for mathematical correctness, returning zero if there is no error.
A speed test is also done.
