Example of bindings to encapsulate a C++ class.  In this case, we bind
the methods for an event queue of (id, time) pairs based on the STL
priority queue class.

This directory contains two different versions of the example.  The "plain"
version uses the prefix "EventQ_" to disambiguate references to class methods.
For example, "EventQ_empty" would refer to the "empty" method of the event
queue class.  The "class" version uses the object-oriented features in MATLAB
to wrap the C++ class in a MATLAB class, so that the "empty" method in C++ can
be mapped to the "empty" method in MATLAB without fear of conflict with any
other methods of the same name.  Because Octave does not support MATLAB-style
OO, this latter version does not work with Octave.
