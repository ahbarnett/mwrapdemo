Example of bindings using the mxArray wrapper.  In this case, we wrap
an STL priority queue of (mxArray, time) pairs.  This is a variant of the
event queue example in the example/eventq subdirectory, except in this
version we can store arbitrary MATLAB data objects in the queue,
rather than just integers.
