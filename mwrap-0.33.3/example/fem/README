This example illustrates several features of MWrap:

 - The binding to the finite element assembly class uses mxArrays directly
   (for sparse matrices).
 - The binding to element types uses inheritance.
 - The bindings to the mesh methods illustrate using zero-based to
   one-based construction.

The finite element source files are in src; the MWrap input files are in
interface.  The MEX file and generated .m files build into the mwfem
subdirectory.
